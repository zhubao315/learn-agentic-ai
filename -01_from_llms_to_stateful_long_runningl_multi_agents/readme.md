# From LLMs to Stateful Long Running Multi-Agent Systems

This document has been split into two separate set of articles, each tackling a unique question:

1. What are AI agents, and what features and functionalities can we anticipate they’ll have?
2. What technological components and infrastructure are needed to build and implement these AI agents?

We’ve developed multiple iterations of these articles, customized to meet the needs of diverse readers, ranging from high school students to tech-savvy professionals.
