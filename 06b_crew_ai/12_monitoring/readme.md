# Monitoring

For monitoring your CrewAI agents, many users have found that leveraging an OpenTelemetry‐based solution is the best approach. In particular, OpenLIT is an excellent observability library that integrates directly with CrewAI—often with just a single line of code. OpenLIT provides vendor-neutral tracing and metrics, which you can then forward to your favorite observability backend (such as Grafana or DataDog).

If you’re looking for a full observability service (with rich dashboards, real‑time tracing, and advanced analytics), many teams also recommend using Arize Phoenix. Arize Phoenix builds on this telemetry data to offer deep insights into agent performance and help fine‑tune workflows.

In summary:
• OpenLIT is a top open‑source library for instrumenting CrewAI with OpenTelemetry.
• For a hosted solution with comprehensive dashboards, Arize Phoenix is a strong complement.

This combination provides both robust instrumentation and powerful visualization for your CrewAI deployments.
