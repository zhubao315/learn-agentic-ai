# DACA Agent-Native Cloud Local Development

This module trains **Agentic AI Developers** to build planet-scale, multi-AI agent systems using the **Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA)** architecture and Agent-Native Cloud Technologies. DACA leverages Kubernetes for orchestration and Dapr for distributed capabilities, with AI agents as stateful Dapr Actors, FastAPI APIs for user interaction, and Pub/Sub for scalable agent communication. The core modules progress from coding to cloud native development, focusing on scalable agents while minimizing noise. 

## Core Modules

- **01_intro_fastapi/**: Build agent endpoints with FastAPI. Covers basics, validation, parameters, and a `/chat` API for DACA agents, integrating later with Dapr Pub/Sub.
- **02_cloud_native_setup/**: Set up Kubernetes for DACA agents. Includes YAML basics, Rancher Desktop, containers, Kubernetes, and Helm for Dapr apps.
- **03_dapr_intro/**: Intro to Dapr with Helm, configuring Pub/Sub (`pubsub.yaml`) and state stores (`statestore.yaml`) for distributed agent logic.
- **04_security_fundamentals** establishes security basics for DACA agents.
- **05_agent_actors** progresses on Dapr Virtual Actors for building DACA agents
- **06_security_advanced** explores advanced security techniques for production-grade security.
- **07_daca_workflows**: Learn to orchestrate complex, AI-driven workflows for long running production systems.

## Getting Started
Follow core modules sequentially or skip based on expertise. Hands-on exercises (e.g., chat API, multi-agent system) build DACA agents. Explore `05_daca_advanced_experimental/` for depth. See module-specific `readme.md` files for details.
